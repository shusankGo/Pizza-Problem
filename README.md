# Pizza-Problem

Given an integer N and a pizza which can be cut into pieces, each cut should be a straight line going from the center of the pizza to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts must be a positive integer. Two pieces are equal if their appropriate angles are equal.

The given pizza can be cut in following three ways:

1. Cut the pizza into N equal pieces.
2. Cut the pizza into N pieces of any size.
3. Cut the pizza into N pieces such that no two of them are equal.

The task is to find if it is possible to cut the pizza in the above ways for a given value of N. Print 1 if possible else 0 for all the cases i.e. print 111 if all the cases are possible.
